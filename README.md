# ACCUConf PDFs

This repository contains all the PDFs offered for inclusion on the [ACCU Conference
website](https://conference.accu.org) website.

After each ACCU conference, PDFs are collected to be associated with the videos on the [ACCU Conference channel on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw/), and linked to from the schedule pages of
the ACCU website.

This repository is separate from the website repository to avoid the problems of that repository getting
huge and unwieldy due to these "blobs".

## Naming Strategy

This repository uses a naming strategy of `presenter_name_-_talk_title.pdf` with all spaces replaced with `_`.
