# ACCUConf PDFs

This repository contains all the PDFs offered for inclusion on
the [ACCUConf website](https://conference.accu.org) website.

After each ACCU conference, PDFs are collected to be associated with the videos on the ACCU channel of
YouTube, and are also put on the ACCU website to be linked to from the schedule page for the conference.

This repository is separate from the website repository to avoid the problems of that repository getting
huge and unwieldy due to these "blobs". Obviously both repositories are needed to build and deploy the
website, that is handled using submodules in the website repository.
